# Due date: Sunday April 30th before midnight
# Write your answers in the space between the questions, and commit/push only
# this file to your repo. Note that there can be a difference between giving a
# "minimally" right answer, and a really good answer, so it can pay to put
# thought into your work. Using functions for organization will be rewarded.

# To answer these questions, you will continue from where you left off in
# homework 4, by using the included file named hw4_data.csv.

# Question 1a: Reshape the data from wide to long, using the wide_to_long function,
# making sure you reset the index to the default values if any of your data is located 
# in the index.  What happened to the POPCHANGE column, and why should it be dropped?

# Question 1b: Repeat the reshaping using the melt method.  Clean up the result so
# that it is the same as the result from 1a (without the POPCHANGE column).

# Question 2: Open the state-visits.xlsx file, and fill in the VISITED column
# with a dummy variable for whether you've visited a state or not.  If you
# haven't been to many states, then filling in a random selection of them
# is fine too.  Save your changes.  Then load the xlsx file as a dataframe in
# Python, and merge the VISITED column into your original long-form population 
# dataframe, only keeping values that appear in both dataframes.  Are any 
# observations dropped from this?  Show code where you investigate your merge, 
# and display any observations that weren't in both dataframes.

# Question 3a: The file policy_uncertainty.xlsx contains monthly measures of 
# economic policy uncertainty for each state.  The EPU_National column esimates
# uncertainty from national sources, EPU_State from state, and EPU_Composite 
# from both (EPU-N, EPU-S, EPU-C).  Load it as a dataframe, then calculate 
# the mean EPU-C value for each state/year, leaving only columns for state, 
# year, and EPU_Composite, with each row being a unique state-year combination.

# Question 3b) Reshape the EPU data into wide format so that each row is unique 
# by state, and the columns represent the EPU-C values for the years 2022, 
# 2021, and 2020. 

# Question 3c) Finally, merge this data into your merged data from question 2, 
# making sure the merge does what you expect.

# Question 4: Using groupby on the VISITED column in the dataframe resulting 
# from the previous question, answer the following questions and show how you  
# calculated them: a) what is the single smallest state by 2022 population  
# that you have visited, and not visited?  b) what are the three largest states  
# by 2022 population you have visited, and the three largest states by 2022 
# population you have not visited? c) do states you have visited or states you  
# have not visited have a higher average EPU-C value in 2022?

# Question 5: Transforming data to have mean zero and unit standard deviation
# is often called "standardization", or a "zscore".  The basic formula to 
# apply to any given value is: (value - mean) / std
# Return to the long-form EPU data you created in step 3a and then, using groupby
# and a function you write, transform the data so that the values for EPU-C
# have mean zero and unit standard deviation for each state.  Add these values
# to a new column named EPU_C_zscore.
